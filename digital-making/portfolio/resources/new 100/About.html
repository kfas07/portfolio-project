       <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Ever since I was a child I was always interested in computers 
          and computer programs. Anytime I had to make a powerpoint presentation
          in school I would always go above and beyond by adding fun transitions,
          music, and animations. My mom had her own graphic design business and 
          I was fascinated by her creative process. When I came to college I took an
          intro level computer science class that introduced me to coding. I 
          instantly loved it and knew I wanted to make a career out of it.
